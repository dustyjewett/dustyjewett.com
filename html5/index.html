              Inherited a JS project dedicated to creating 1:1 fidelity renderings of Excel Spreadsheet Charts in the browser. 
              I fixed bugs, refactored to more modern buid chains (grunt), and created regression test software that could visually diff the output. 
              Despite being the single most commonly used JS code in our site, it was able to shift into maintenance mode, and would go 3-9 months without needing changes.

              Took over Rails team, hired 6 devs over 9 months. Architected a move to 'right-sized' micro-services, enabling green-field development
              without modifying the 4+ year old Rails site. Through an ever-present focus on bugs and stability, was able to reduce
              support requirements from 1-2 Sr devs per week to less than 1 Jr dev per week.

              Built several prototypes in conjunction with UX and Product Team for pitching new/greenfield development.  Worked with client to find a technical solution that matched their desire to have a single language powering their Frontend and Backend. Lead UI Development utilizing Vaadin, Java and Groovy for two new projects.  Implemented several patterns, including MVVM, which allowed a more structured and contemporary paradigm than provided by Vaadin alone.

              Ported Flex 4 application previously developed into an HTML5/JS application, as users started requesting the ability to use the product on their tablets.  Utilized Backbone, jQuery and HighCharts to create an application that was as functional on the small iPad screen as it was on the desktop.

            <p>
              Created a secondary app that shares views with the primary app, 'proving' that backbone can create components that are reusable between apps.

      			Led team of 4 developers to create a full-featured WebApp for Real's Music/Photo/Video Cloud solution. Coordinated with five other dev teams, along with Design and QA, to be the 'first adopter' of many new features and designs.<br/>
      			Architected many of the systems that drove the UI, including a system that could query and cache multiple levels of data, and a navigation system that could handle the complex UI paradigms the designers dreamt up (though the most complex never shipped).<br />
      			Developed many custom UI Components, including a complex and animated breadcrumb bar, TileLists that could handle non-sequential loading of data, and screens that behaved differently based on the state of many different variables (though I argued against the last one, on usability issues, and lost).

Focused on the creation of UI components that were customizable to the specific usage, but were able to maintain the business logic that was required for company-wide auditing requirements.  I often had to find compromises between the business/legal requirements and the requests of an individual department.

We meet once a month, and I often give short intro-to-X talks, prior to a main speaker.  Usually once or twice a year, I give a longer 2-hour presentation.
